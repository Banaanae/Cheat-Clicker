## I am aware of AutoHotKey 2.0 release and will be working to update the scripts
# Cheat-Clicker

- Cheat clicker is an open source cheat for clicking faster
- It works by detecting when you click and sending x more instead
- Feel free to make pull requests / issues it really helps me out

## How to use

- Go to [releases](https://github.com/Banaanae/Cheat-Clicker/releases/latest) and download Cheat-Clicker.exe
- Run the exe and type how many clicks you want to do per click (e.g. if you type 3 you will click three times for every click)
- When you are finished or want to change your clicks per click press the stop key you set (to stop press the close button)

## Running the source

- Download the current version of [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) and wait for it to install
- Double click the ahk script and it should run
- (Optional) You can compile the script by right clicking it and pressing compile (Make sure it complies with the [license](https://github.com/Banaanae/Cheat-Clicker/blob/main/LICENSE) if you release it)
