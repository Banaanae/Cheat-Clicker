# Cheat-Clicker
- Cheat clicker is an open source cheat for clicking faster
- It works by detecting when you click and sending x more instead
- Feel free to make pull requests / issues it really helps me out

### How to use
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/Banaanae/Cheat-Clicker/releases/latest) and download Cheat-Clicker.exe
- Run the exe and type how many clicks you want to do per click (e.g. if you type 3 you will click three times for every click)
- When you are finished or want to change your clicks per click press the stop key you set (to stop press the close button)
